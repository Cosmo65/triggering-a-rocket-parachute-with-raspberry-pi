# triggering-a-rocket-parachute-with-raspberry-pi

The objective of this program is to simulate the activation of a rocket's parachute with the use of a Raspberry Pi and Arduino. Raspberry Pi helps with data processing thanks to Python. The arduino performs a great service when it comes to transferring the sensed data
for processing them.

Note: the ultrasound simulates a pressure sensor and the led simulates the activation by a squib.
